	/// When a symmetric cipher is combined with block mode of operation, the obtained cipher construction is denoted by the names of the cipher and the block mode and the key size. Examples:
	/// AES-256-GCM - the AES cipher with a 256-bit encryption key and GCM block mode
	/// AES-128-CTR - the AES cipher with a 128-bit encryption key and CTR block mode
