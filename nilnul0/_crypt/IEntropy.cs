	/// <summary>
	/// In computing, entropy is the randomness collected by an operating system or application for use in cryptography or other uses that require random data. This randomness is
	///		often collected from hardware sources
	///			(variance in fan noise or HDD),
	///			 keyboard timings,
	///			either pre-existing ones such as mouse movements
	///			network interrupts can be used
	///			 the number of free bytes in memory
	///			 
	///			 system clock
	///			 Interrupt timings
	///			 a sensor to measure the air turbulence inside a disk drive.
	///			or specially provided randomness generators.
	///			sound cards and webcams may be a better source of randomness than hardware made for that purpose.
	///	A lack of entropy can have a negative impact on performance and security.
