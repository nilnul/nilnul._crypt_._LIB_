	/// EdDSA (Edwards-curve Digital Signature Algorithm) is a modern and secure digital signature algorithm based on performance-optimized elliptic curves, such as the 255-bit curve  and the 448-bit curve . The EdDSA signatures use the Edwards form of the elliptic curves (for performance reasons), respectively edwards25519 and edwards448. The EdDSA algorithm is based on the  and relies on the difficulty of the ECDLP problem.
